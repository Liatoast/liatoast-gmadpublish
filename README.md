# Welcome to my Unofficial Backup Linux GMAD/GMPublish Repository

Why did I Create this Repository?


# How do I use & Install this?

__**Requirements:**__

- A Linux Server, preferably with ``Debian 9/10/11`` or some Flavor of ``Ubuntu`` (Tested with Debian 10 & 11).
- ``Git`` Installed on your Server
- The Server Processor should have atleast 3 GHz Single Core Performance when your creating Large Addons with many Files. (You cannot use Multiple Cores, so as I said Single Core Performance is much more needed than Multi Core Performance!)
- Atleast 8 GB of RAM available on your Server for the Addon Creation.

__Optional, if you want to Upload aswell your Addons to the Steam Workshop directly via your Server:__

- A ``Desktop Enviroment`` installed like ``GNOME``, ``KDE`` or ``XFCE`` on your Server.
- A ``VNC Server`` Program Installed on your Server like ``TigerVNC`` or ``TightVNC`` and a ``VNC Client`` like ``RealVNC`` on your Computer.
- ``SteamCMD`` and ``Steam`` (https://store.steampowered.com/about/) Installed on your Server.

__**Installing:**__

__This should work on the above mentioned Debian 9/10/11 Release.__

First of all a

First ``git clone https://github.com/Liatori-GR/linux-gmad``

If you want to use ``GMPublish`` make sure you have installed a ``Desktop Enviroment/DE`` like ``GNOME`` or ``KDE`` and have Installed the ``GUI Version`` of ``Steam`` (Not SteamCMD!) on your Server and logged into Steam with your Account.

After you logged in you can now properly use ``GMPublish`` and Upload your Addons with your Server.
