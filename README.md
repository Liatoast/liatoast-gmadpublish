# Linux GMAD/GMPublisher Executables

This are the Original Linux Executables for Garry's Mod Addon Creation and Publishing, they are Ported from the Debian/Ubuntu Release.

Sometimes you will need to copy the libsteam_api.so File into the ``/lib/`` Folder of your Operating System, also I do NOT have made any of these Files and Credit and Copyright are held from the Original Creators.

This Repository was made because for some weird Reason when you Install GMod Server via the SteamCMD on a Server your missing gmpublish and gmad, so when you have a Garbage Connection and Processor but a Strong Server you can easily offload the Addon Creation and Uploading Process to the actual Server.
