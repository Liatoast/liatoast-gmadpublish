# Linux GMAD/GMPublisher Executables

This are the Original Linux Executables and Libraries for Garry's Mod Addon Creation and Publishing on Linux.

Sometimes you will need to copy the ``libsteam_api.so`` File into the ``/lib/`` Folder of your Operating System, also I do NOT have made any of these Files and Credit and Copyright are held from the Original Creators.

These Files are Ported and used on the ``Debian/Ubuntu`` Operating System, and tested only on these Operating Systems.

This Repository was made because for some weird Reason when you Install GMod Server via the SteamCMD on a Server your missing gmpublish and gmad, so when you have a Garbage Connection and Processor but a Strong Server you can easily offload the Addon Creation and Uploading Process to the actual Server.

# How to use this?

First of all Clone the Repository with ``git clone https://github.com/Liatori-GR/linux-gmad``, after that you open the Folder and enter in your Terminal ``./gmad`` for Addon Creation, if you want to Upload Files you use ``./gmpublish``

If you want to use ``GMPublish`` make sure you have installed a ``Desktop Enviroment/DE`` like ``GNOME`` or ``KDE`` and have Installed the ``GUI Version`` of ``Steam`` (Not SteamCMD!) on your Server and logged into Steam with your Account.

After you logged in you can now properly use ``GMPublish`` and Upload your Addons with your Server.

Do not create any Issues or Pull Requests because I do not Own the Source Code or am I able to Edit the Source Files, these as I mentioned above not my Files and this Repository is just a Backup Repository!
